max_salary amount exceeding the upper limit 25000. Also set job_id as
primary key and entering null values for job_title is not allowed.
    -> create table jobs
    -> (job_id int primary key,
    -> job_title varchar(20) not null,
    -> min_salary int,
    -> max_salary int check(max_salary <= 25000));

4.Write a SQL statement to create a table named job_histry including columns
employee_id, start_date, end_date, job_id and department_id.
    -> create table job_histry
    -> (employee_id int,
    -> start_date date,
    -> end_date date,
    -> job_id varchar(20),
    -> department_id int);

5.Write an SQL statement to alter a table named countries to make sure that no
duplicate data against column country_id will be allowed at the time of
insertion.
    -> alter table countries
    -> modify column country_id int unique;

6.Write an SQL statement to create a table named jobs including columns job_id,
job_title, min_salary and max_salary, and make sure that, the default value
for job_title is blank and min_salary is 8000 and max_salary is NULL will be
entered automatically at the time of insertion if no value assigned for the
specified columns.
    -> create table job
    -> (job_id int,
    -> job_title varchar(15) default ' ',
    -> min_salary int default 8000,
    -> max_salary int default null );

7.Create a Department table
    -> create table Department
    -> (Dep_ID decimal(4,0) not null default 0,
    -> Dep_name varchar(30) not null Default 'Null',
    -> Manager_ID decimal(6,0) not null default 0,
    -> Location_ID decimal(4,0),
    -> primary key (Dep_ID , Manager_ID));


8.Write an SQL statement to create a table employees including columns
employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number hire_date, job_id,
salary, commission, manager_id and department_id and make sure that, the

manager_id columns contain only those unique combination values, which
combinations are exists in the departments table.
    -> create table employees
    -> (employee_id int primary key,
    -> first_name varchar(15),

    -> phone_number bigint,
    -> hire_date date,
    -> job_id int,
    -> salary int,
    -> commission int,

    -> alter table employees
    -> add column manager_id decimal(6,0);

    -> alter table employees
    -> add foreign key(department_id , manager_id)
    -> references department(Dep_ID, Manager_ID);
